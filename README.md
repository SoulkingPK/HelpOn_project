🔰 Project Name: HelpOn
🔎 One-Liner:

A real-time app that connects people in danger or distress to nearby helpers — faster than waiting for official services.

💡 Problem It Solves

Emergencies (harassment, accidents, panic attacks, theft, getting lost, etc.) often happen in public places.

Police or ambulances can take time, and people around may not realize help is needed.

Many people want to help, but there’s no real-time system to alert or connect them.

🧩 Core Idea

HelpOn creates a network of volunteers and bystanders who can respond instantly when someone nearby triggers an emergency alert.

It’s like a “Zomato of nearby helpers” — but for emergencies, not food.

🧠 How It Works – User Flow
1. ✅ Sign-Up & Roles

> Anyone can sign up as a User, Helper, or both.

> Verified users can opt into “available to help nearby” mode (like Uber drivers going online).

2. 🆘 Triggering an Emergency

> A user can press a 1-tap SOS button from the app.

> They can choose the reason:

> ⚠️ Harassment

> 🚨 Health emergency

> 🧭 Lost/stranded

> 🚗 Road accident

> 🤯 Panic attack or anxiety

3. 📍 Alert Nearby Helpers

> The app locates trusted people within a 300–500m radius.

> Sends:

> 🔔 Push notification with live location

> 🗣️ Live mic/audio stream (optional)

> 📸 Instant selfie or text message

> Helpers can accept the request like a task.

4. 📡 Optional Auto Actions

> Auto-send SMS to emergency contact.

> Call ambulance/police (integrated).

> Trigger loud siren on phone.

5. 👥 Response System

> Nearest helper sees route on map.

> In-app navigation to user.

> On arrival: user confirms safety via OTP or "Safe now" toggle.

6. 📊 Aftermath & Community

> User can rate the response.

> Helper gets points and badges.

> Leaderboard for helpful users (gamification).

> Daily opt-in mode (e.g., “I’m available to help today”).
